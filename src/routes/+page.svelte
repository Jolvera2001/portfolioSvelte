                    I'm a senior and will be graduating in December of 2024. I'm currently seeking employment and other
                opportunities to start a career in Software Engineering. I'm constantly learning new frameworks and tools that
                can be used to develop different kinds of applications, but I'm also excited to come up with more projects
                in order to gain more experience.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">I've gone through multiple projects, one in an Internship and the others
            as college projects. My project at my internship introduced me to desktop application development as well as
            giving me exposure to working with a professional team at a company. My two other projects have given me experience
            in working with mobile app development and full stack web development with both using cloud services like Firebase
            and Azure.</p>
