# Portfolio Project
## Reasoning
I think after having some experience already, it's time to make my own website as a portfolio. It'll be a good way to learn some new technologies like Svelte and some CSS Framework. 

## What to add
After deploying on Azure, next steps would be
- Filling out contact info
    - Github Link
    - LinkedIn Link
- Filling in the white space
- Learning how to use SVGs for some use
- Using more scripting in order to give life to the page

## Technologies Used
- Azure
- SvelteKit and Svelte
- Tailwind CSS
